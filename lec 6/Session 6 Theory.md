## api calling in react app
if we call api directly in react inside body it will renrender everything for some small change 
A:two  ways to load site

1---user load the page => api(took 300ms)=>renderpage(took 200ms)= output comes in 500 ms

2---user load the page => render page (show somthing )=> api(took 300ms)=>update ui with api = output comes fast

2 is efficient  

so here we use anathor hook that is useeffect
here in use effect we use callback function and the depnedency so that its not going to immidietly get call  but get call when we needded ,its areact that make sure it will gwt call at specific time

* so when a component rerenders --it re renders when a prop changes or state changes 
* side note **prop**
    * props are properties
    * so here  ...restaurent.info is a prop
    *   ```
      <div className="RL">
        {FilteredRestaurent.map((restaurant) => {
          return (
            <RestaurentCard {...restaurant.info} key={restaurant.info.id} />
              );
            })}
          </
      div>
      ```

  ```
 
  useEffect(() => { callback

  },[]//dependency array)

  ```
0. so if we dont want to call it after every rerender so  we pass depndency array through it
1. here if we dont write [] (event the empty one ) it will be called after each render  
1. if it is not dependent on anything (if [] is empty )it will just call it just  once
2. if dependent  array [searchText] ==> call ==>once after initial render + render everytime i write a single alphabet in search text

so therefore

```
just to play with it 

   useEffect (() => {
    console.log ("call this when dependencty is changed")
   },[])

  so lets make api call inside useeffect
  useEffect(() => { //api call
  },[])

  so that it could be 
  2---load => render page (show somthing )=> call api (took 300ms)=>update ui with api = output comes fast 


```
*  so we going to call api inside empty dependency array
```
// this is inside body function
  useEffect(() => {
    getRestaurants()
  }, []);

  //to fetch api

async function getRestaurants(){
  const data =await fetch ("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=18.61610&lng=73.72860&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING
  ")

  const json = await data.json();
  console.log (json);
}

but it cannot call swigy api url unless we use cors 

```
## CORS
Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Failed to fetch 
reason your browse stopping you bc its not posiible to make conversion with swiggy using local host

to solve this we install plugin name cors wa
what is cors 
search in for yt for cors by akshay saini 

## to insert swiggy api in our ui 
* so now we dont need restaurent list we are going to put json data into restaurent ,but we wont delete restaurentlist (initial value),so that it initialy it renders the given data and then after use effect called it renders the live data from swiggy api by putting json data into setRestaurnt() variable 

```
  async function getRestaurent () {
    const data = await fetch("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=18.61610&lng=73.72860&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING");

    const json =await data.json();
    //optional chaining
    setRestaurant(
      //writing path of our data
      json?.data?.cards[4]?.card.card.gridElements.infoWithStyle.restaurants
    );
   } 
```
## final code
```
import { ResaturentList } from "./config";
import { RestaurentCard } from "./RestaurentCard";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Shimmer from "./Nav-Bar/Shimmer";

function filterData(searchText, allrestaurant) {
  const filterData = allrestaurant.filter((restaurant)=> restaurant?.info?.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase()));
  return filterData }

export const Body = () => {
 
  const [allrestaurant, setAllRestaurant] = useState([]); 
  const [filteredrestaurant, setFilteredrestaurant] = useState([]); 
  const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");

  //use effect
   useEffect (() => {
    getRestaurent()
   },[])

   //writing a function for api 

   async function getRestaurent () {
    const data = await fetch("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=18.61610&lng=73.72860&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING");

    const json =await data.json();
    //optional chaining
    setAllRestaurant(
      //writing path of our data

    );

    setFilteredrestaurant(
      //writing path of our data
      json?.data?.cards[4]?.card.card.gridElements.infoWithStyle.restaurants
    );
   } 

   if (!allrestaurant) return null;
   console.log(allrestaurant)
   if (allrestaurant?.length === 0)
     return <Shimmer></Shimmer>
 
   return filteredrestaurant?.length === 0 ? (
     <h1>No Restaurent match your search</h1>
   ) :(
    <>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          className="searchInput"
          placeholder="Search"
          value={searchText}
          onChange={(e) => {
            setSearchText(e.target.value);
          }}
        ></input>
        <button
          className="search-btn"
          onClick={() => {
            const data = filterData(searchText, allrestaurant);
            setFilteredrestaurant(data);
          }}
        >
          Search
        </button>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div className="RL">
          {filteredrestaurant.map((restaurant) => {
            return (
              <RestaurentCard {...restaurant.info} key={restaurant.info.id} />
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

*if we dont want restaurent list to load we can use shimmer ui also 
## Q: What is `Microservice`?
A: **`Microservice`** - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services like database, server or a UI of the application, that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
**means we are dividing software into small, well-defined modules enables teams to use functions for multiple purposes.**

- Benefits of Microservices:
  - Flexible Scaling
  - Easy Deployment
  - Technological Freedom
  - Reusable Code
  - Resilience


  **so basically**
    * Imagine you have a big Lego castle to build. Instead of trying to build it all at once, you split it into smaller pieces, like towers, walls, and gates. Each piece does its own job, but they all work together to make the whole castle.

    * That's kind of like microservices! **Instead of one big program doing everything, you have lots of smaller programs (or services) that each do one thing really well**. They work together like puzzle pieces to make a bigger program.

## Q: What is `Monolith architecture`?
A: A `Monolith architecture`(opposite to micro services) is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.
means we are not dividing software into small, well-defined modules, we use every services like, database, server or a UI of the application, in one Application file.

## Q: What is the difference between `Monolith and Microservice`?
A: With `monolithic architectures`, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled. Adding or improving a monolithic applicationâ€™s features becomes more complex as the code base grows. This complexity limits experimentation and makes it difficult to implement new ideas. Monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because many dependent and tightly coupled processes increase the impact of a single process failure.

With a `microservices architecture`, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs. Services are built for business capabilities and each service performs a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.

## Q: Why do we need a `useEffect Hook`?
A: `useEffect Hook` is javascript function provided by `react`. The useEffect Hook allows you to  `eliminate side effects` in your components. Some examples of side effects are: `fetching API data`, `directly updating the DOM`, and `setting up subscriptions or timers`, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects.
useEffect accepts `two arguments`, a `callback function` and a `dependency array`. The second argument is optional.

```
useEffect(() => {}, [])
```
The `() => {}` is callback function and `[]` is called a empty dependency array. 
If anything that we pass (suppose currentState) inside the `[]` it trigger the callback function and changes the state of the application.
```
useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentState("true");
}, [currentState])
```
If we do not pass empty dependency array then the useEffect runs everytime when the UI is rendered.

```
useEffect(() => {})
```


## Q: What is `Optional Chaining`?
A: `Optional Chaining` (`?.`) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is `undefined or null` , it returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.
`Optional Chaining` (`?.`) is good way of accessing the object keys, it prevents the application from being crashed if the key that we are trying to access is not present. If the key is not present then instead of a throwing key error, it returns `undefined`.


## Q: What is `Shimmer UI`?
A: A `Shimmer UI` resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (while UI currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load.
Shimmer UI is a great way for loading the applications. Instead of showing a loading circle we can design a shimmer UI for our application that is good for user experience.


## Q: What is the difference between `JS expression and JS statement`?
A: A `JS expression` returns a value that we use in the application. for example: 
```
1 + 2 // expresses 
"foo".toUpperCase() // expresses 'FOO'
console.log(2) // logs '2'
isTrue ? true : false // returns us a true or false value based on isTrue value
```
A `JS statement`, does not return a value. for example:
```
let x; // variable declaration
if () { } // if condition
```
If we want to use `JS expression` in JSX, we have to wrap in `{/* expression slot */}` and if we want to use `JS statement` in JSX, we have to wrap in `{(/* statement slot */)}`;


## Q: What is `Conditional Rendering`? explain with a code example.
A: `Conditional rendering` in React works the same way conditions work in `JavaScript`. Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them. for example:
```
// Using Ternary operator as a shorthand way or writing an if-else statement
{isLoggedIn ? (return <UserGreeting />) : (return <GuestGreeting />)};
// Using an ifâ€¦else Statement
{
  (if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  }else {
    return <GuestGreeting />;
  })
}
// Using Logical &&
{isLoggedIn && <button>Logout</button>}
```


## Q: What is `CORS`?
A: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.


## Q: What is `async and await`?
A: `Async`: It simply allows us to write promises-based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread. It operates asynchronously via the event loop. Async functions will always return a promise. It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then JavaScript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.
`Await`: Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the `async` block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.
for example: 
```
// async function getRestaurant to fetch Swiggy API data
  async function getRestaurants() {
    const data = await fetch(
      "Swiggy_API_URL"
    );
    const json = await data.json();
    // we get the Swiggy API data in json format
    console.log(json);
  }
```


## Q: What is the use of `const json = await data.json()`; in `getRestaurants()`?
A: The `data` object, returned by the `await fetch()`, is a generic placeholder for multiple data formats.
so we can extract the `JSON object` from a `fetch` response by using `await data.json()`.
`data.json()` is a method on the data object that lets you extract a `JSON object` from the data or response. The method returns a promise because we have used `await` keyword.
so `data.json()` returns a promise resolved to a `JSON object`.
